Making php and mysqli work together


1. In php folder copy and paste php.ini-production file so you have a duplicate

2. Rename to php.ini

3. Edit the php.ini file

4.Find on line 930
;extension=mysqli

Remove ; to uncomment it, should be around the following:
;extension=exif      ; Must be after mbstring as it depends on it
;extension=mysqli
;extension=oci8_12c  ; Use with Oracle Database 12c Instant Client

5. Then change it to extension=php_mysqli.dll

6. Go to line 765
extension_dir = "ext"

7. Change to whatever your php folder \ext is, for example:

extension_dir = "C:\Users\murra\Desktop\php-8.1.10-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\ext"

8. Save and then you're fully setup!

When running a new php file or changing files, you must open the folder in the explorer, or else it will not properly work if you just open the .php file instead of opening it in folder and running it through explorer
